## 🔧 Prerequisites

### Required Accounts:
- [Railway](https://railway.app) (Free tier for backend)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (Free tier for frontend)
- Domain with subdomain access
- ✅ MongoDB cluster (You already have this)

### Required Tools:
```bash
# Node.js 18+ required
node --version  # Should be 18.0.0 or higher
npm --version   # Latest version
```

---

## 📊 Database Setup (Existing MongoDB Cluster)

### Step 1: Use Your Existing MongoDB Connection
```bash
# You already have:
✅ MongoDB cluster running
✅ Database access configured
✅ Connection string available

# Use your existing connection string format:
mongodb+srv://username:password@your-cluster.xxxxx.mongodb.net/quickpe?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### Step 2: Initialize Database with Test Data
```bash
# Clone the repository locally first
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd QuickPe

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Create .env file with your existing MongoDB connection
cat > .env << EOF
MONGODB_URI=your-existing-mongodb-connection-string
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-key-minimum-32-characters-long
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5001
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
EOF

# Run database initialization scripts (these exist in backend/scripts/)
node scripts/create-test-users-simple.js
node scripts/create-comprehensive-test-data.js
node scripts/populate_transactions.js
```

---

## 🖥️ Backend Deployment (Railway)

### Step 1: Prepare Backend for Deployment
```bash
# Ensure backend/package.json has correct scripts
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "dev": "nodemon server.js"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway
```bash
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign up/Login with GitHub account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Choose your QuickPe repository
6. Railway will auto-detect Node.js and deploy
```

### Step 3: Configure Railway Service
```bash
1. In Railway dashboard, click on your deployed service
2. Go to "Settings" tab
3. Configure:
   - Name: quickpe-backend
   - Root Directory: backend
   - Start Command: npm start
   - Build Command: npm install
4. Click "Deploy" to redeploy with new settings
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables
```bash
# In Railway dashboard → Variables tab, add:
NODE_ENV=production

FRONTEND_URL=https://quickpe.yourdomain.com
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password

# Railway automatically assigns PORT, no need to set it manually
```

### Step 5: Get Railway Domain
```bash
# Railway provides a domain like:
https://quickpe-backend-production.up.railway.app

# Or set custom domain in Settings → Domains:
https://api.quickpe.yourdomain.com
```

### Step 6: Verify Backend Deployment
```bash
# Test health endpoint:
curl https://quickpe-backend-production.up.railway.app/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-15T...",
  "environment": "production",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "database": "connected"
}

# Test API status:
curl https://quickpe-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/status

# Expected response:
{
  "api": "QuickPe Backend",
  "status": "running",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-15T...",
  "deployment": "Railway"
}
```

---

## 🌐 Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

### Step 1: Configure Frontend API URL
```bash
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: Update frontend/src/services/api/client.js
# Current code has wrong default URL - fix this:
const getApiBaseUrl = () => {
  if (import.meta.env.PROD) {
    // MUST use VITE_API_URL environment variable in production
    return import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'https://quickpe-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/v1';
  }
  return 'http://localhost:5001/api/v1';
};
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
```bash
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign up/Login with GitHub account
3. Click "Add New..." → Project
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Configure deployment settings:
   - Framework Preset: Vite
   - Root Directory: frontend
   - Build Command: npm run build
   - Output Directory: dist
   - Install Command: npm install
6. Click "Deploy"
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
```bash
# In Vercel dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:
VITE_API_URL=https://quickpe-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/v1

# Apply to all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
```

### Step 4: Verify Frontend Build
```bash
# Check Vercel deployment logs for:
✅ Build completed successfully
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ No ESLint warnings
✅ Static files generated in dist/

# Your frontend will be available at:
https://quickpe-frontend.vercel.app
```

### Step 5: Configure Custom Domain

2. Add domain: quickpe.yourdomain.com
3. Configure DNS:
   - Type: CNAME
   - Name: quickpe
   - Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

## 🔗 Production Connection Verification

### Step 1: Update Backend CORS for Railway
```javascript
// backend/server.js - Update CORS origins
const corsOptions = {
  origin: [
    "https://quickpe.yourdomain.com",
    "https://quickpe-frontend.vercel.app", 
    "https://quickpe-backend-production.up.railway.app",
    process.env.FRONTEND_URL
  ],
  // ... rest of config
};
```

### Step 2: Test Backend-Frontend Connection
```bash
# 1. Test Railway backend health
curl https://quickpe-backend-production.up.railway.app/health

# 2. Test API endpoints from frontend domain
curl -X POST https://quickpe-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/auth/signin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Origin: https://quickpe.yourdomain.com" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"test123"}'

# 3. Verify CORS headers in response
```

### Step 3: Test Socket.io Connection
```bash
# Open browser console on https://quickpe.yourdomain.com
# Run this JavaScript:
const socket = io('https://quickpe-backend-production.up.railway.app');
socket.on('connect', () => console.log('✅ Socket.io connected'));
socket.on('disconnect', () => console.log('❌ Socket.io disconnected'));
```

### Step 4: End-to-End Production Test
```bash
# Complete flow verification:
1. Visit: https://quickpe.yourdomain.com
2. Sign in with: siddharth@quickpe.com / password123
3. Check browser Network tab for:
   ✅ API calls to Railway backend successful (200 status)
   ✅ Socket.io connection established
   ✅ No CORS errors in console
   ✅ JWT token stored in localStorage
   ✅ Real-time notifications working
```

### Step 5: Production Monitoring Setup
```bash
