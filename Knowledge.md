# Wallet Application - Knowledge Base

## 1. Project Summary

This is a full-stack digital wallet application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The application allows users to create accounts, manage their wallet balance, search for other users, and transfer money between accounts.

### Current Features:
- User registration and authentication system
- JWT-based authentication with middleware protection
- Real-time user search functionality
- Money transfer between users with database transactions
- Balance management and display
- Responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS

### Tech Stack & Architecture:

**Backend:**
- **Node.js** with Express.js framework
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose ODM for data persistence
- **JWT** for authentication and session management
- **Zod** for input validation and schema enforcement
- **CORS** enabled for cross-origin requests
- Database transactions for secure money transfers

**Frontend:**
- **React 18** with functional components and hooks
- **Vite** as the build tool and development server
- **React Router DOM** for client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsive design
- **Axios** for HTTP API calls
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI elements

**Database Schema:**
- **Users Collection**: Stores user credentials and profile information
- **Accounts Collection**: Manages wallet balances linked to users via ObjectId references

## 2. Existing Features

### 2.1 User Authentication System
**How it works:** 
- Users register with email, password, first name, and last name
- Zod validation ensures email format and required fields
- JWT tokens are generated upon successful signup/signin
- Middleware validates tokens for protected routes

**Strengths:**
- Input validation with Zod prevents malformed data
- JWT-based stateless authentication
- Automatic account creation with random initial balance

**Areas for improvement:**
- **Security**: Passwords are stored in plain text (no hashing)
- **UX**: No email verification process
- **UI**: Basic form design, lacks modern styling patterns
- **Error handling**: Generic error messages, poor user feedback

### 2.2 Money Transfer System
**How it works:**
- Users can transfer money to other users by selecting from a user list
- Database transactions ensure atomicity (both debit and credit operations succeed or fail together)
- Authentication required via JWT middleware
- Real-time balance updates

**Strengths:**
- Proper database transactions prevent data inconsistency
- Authentication-protected transfers
- Clean API design with proper error responses

**Areas for improvement:**
- **UX**: No transfer confirmation dialog
- **UI**: Basic transfer interface, lacks transaction history
- **Security**: No transfer limits or fraud detection
- **Features**: No transaction receipts or notifications

### 2.3 User Search & Discovery
**How it works:**
- Real-time search functionality filters users by first name or last name
- MongoDB regex queries for partial matching
- Debounced search input for performance

**Strengths:**
- Real-time search with instant results
- Clean user interface with avatar placeholders
- Direct integration with money transfer flow

**Areas for improvement:**
- **Performance**: No pagination for large user lists
- **UX**: Search only by name, not by email or username
- **UI**: Basic user cards, lacks additional user information
- **Security**: Exposes all user data to any authenticated user

### 2.4 Dashboard & Balance Management
**How it works:**
- Displays current wallet balance
- Shows list of all users for potential transfers
- Simple navigation with app bar

**Strengths:**
- Clean, minimal dashboard design
- Easy access to core functionality

**Areas for improvement:**
- **Features**: Balance is hardcoded, not fetched from API
- **UI**: Static balance display, no transaction history
- **UX**: No quick actions or shortcuts
- **Analytics**: No spending insights or balance trends
