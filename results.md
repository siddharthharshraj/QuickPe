## Honest Assessment of Resume Claims

### Claim 1: "Sub-200ms transaction processing with 1000+ concurrent users"
**Reality:** 
- ❌ **Not Tested:** No load testing for 1000+ users
- ❌ **Local Only:** Performance measured on development environment
- ⚠️ **Estimate:** Likely 50-500ms response times in development
- ⚠️ **Scalability:** Would require production infrastructure testing

### Claim 2: "10,000+ daily transactions with 99.9% uptime"
**Reality:**
- ❌ **No Production Data:** Application hasn't been deployed to production
- ❌ **No Monitoring:** No uptime monitoring or transaction volume tracking
- ⚠️ **Theoretical:** Architecture could support this with proper infrastructure

### Claim 3: "60% reduction in customer support queries"
**Reality:**
- ❌ **No Baseline:** No before/after data available
- ❌ **No Users:** Application hasn't been deployed to real users
- ✅ **Features Exist:** PDF statements and self-service features are implemented

### Claim 4: "85+ Lighthouse performance scores, 45% load time reduction"
**Reality:**
- ❌ **Not Measured:** No Lighthouse audits performed
- ❌ **No Baseline:** No before/after performance comparison
- ⚠️ **Modern Stack:** React + Tailwind should perform well when optimized
